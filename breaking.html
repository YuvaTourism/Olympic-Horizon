        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Breaking is an urban dance style that originated in the United States in the 1970s. With roots in hip-hop culture, breaking first took form in the lively block parties in the Bronx borough of New York, and is characterised by acrobatic movements, stylised footwork, and the key role played by the DJ and the MC (master of ceremonies) during battles.

                International competitions were first held in the 1990s, popularising the dance form both among hip-hop communities and the general public along the way.Breaking featured at the Summer Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires in 2018. Following its outstanding success at the Games in Argentina, breaking was added to the Paris 2024 Olympic programme as a new sport.</p>
