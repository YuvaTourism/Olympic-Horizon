        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Curling made its Olympic debut at the **1924 Winter Olympics** in Chamonix, France, but was only considered a demonstration sport afterward until it was officially reinstated at the **1998 Nagano Winter Olympics**. Its inclusion as a full medal sport came after a long history of curling as a popular winter sport in countries like Canada, Scotland, and Sweden. Curling involves teams sliding stones on ice towards a target, with players using brooms to influence the stoneâ€™s path and speed, emphasizing strategy, precision, and teamwork.

                Since its reintroduction in 1998, curling has become a fan favorite at the Winter Games, with Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland often dominating the podium. The sport expanded further with the addition of **mixed doubles curling** at the **2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics**, where teams of one man and one woman compete together. Curling's unique mix of skill and strategy has helped it maintain a lasting presence in the Winter Olympic lineup.</p>
