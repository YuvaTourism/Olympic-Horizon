            <p class="para">Cricket was first played in southern England in the 16th century but it was not until 1744 that the 'Laws of Cricket' were codified with the first recorded women's match taking place a year later.

                Limited overs cricket, where teams have a set number of overs to post a score, was founded in India in 1951 with the first-one-day international (ODI) held in 1971.Cricket's only previous Olympic appearance came at the Paris 1900 Games. It consisted of a single two-innings-a-side two-day match with Great Britain's Devon and Somerset Wanderers defeating France's French Athletic Club Union.
