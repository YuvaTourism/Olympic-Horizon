        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Flag football is set to make its Olympic debut at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, marking the first time a form of American football will be featured in the Olympic Games. The inclusion of flag football reflects the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) push to bring more youth-oriented and globally accessible sports to the program. Unlike traditional tackle football, flag football is a non-contact sport where players aim to pull flags from opponents' belts rather than tackling them, making it safer and more inclusive.

                The decision to include flag football aligns with the growing international popularity of the sport, which is governed by the International Federation of American Football (IFAF). The NFL has also been a key supporter of flag football's Olympic bid, seeing it as a way to expand American football's global reach. With its fast-paced, dynamic gameplay, flag football is expected to attract a wide audience at the 2028 Olympics, showcasing both men's and women's teams in competition.</p>
