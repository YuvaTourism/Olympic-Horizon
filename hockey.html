            <p class="para">Hockey takes its name from the French word “hocquet”, meaning a shepherd’s crook in reference to the curved shape of a hockey stick. The roots of the game stretch back to antiquity, as records show an early form of the sport practised 4,000 years ago in Egypt, with variations played in what is now Ethiopia (1000 BC) and Iran (2000 BC).
                Modern hockey emerged in England in the mid-19th century and was developed at private schools (like Eton) throughout the country. A hockey association was formed in the country in 1875, but dissolved after seven years; in 1886 the Hockey Association was created in England and worked to establish the first set of rules for the game.
