        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Table tennis first appeared at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, with singles and doubles competitions for men and women. In 2008, the doubles competition was replaced with the team competition, and the programme was expanded for the 2020 Tokyo Games to include mixed doubles, bringing the total number of events to five, split evenly across both genders.

                Up until the mid-20th century, the sport was dominated by central European countries such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. However, since table tennis became a part of the Olympic programme at Seoul 1988, athletes representing the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China have prevailed, winning a total of 60 medals (including 32 golds) at the Games.</p>
