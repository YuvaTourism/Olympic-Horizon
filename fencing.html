        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Fencing’s origins can be found in swordplay, which has been practised for thousands of years—as evidenced by the discovery of carvings depicting fencers that date to around 1190 BCE which were discovered in a temple near Luxor, Egypt.

                Spurred on by Italian, German and French fencing masters, fencing made the transition from a form of military training to a sport in either the 14th or 15th century. Fencing is now practised all over the world, generating fierce competition not only in Europe but also in Asia, Oceania, the Americas and Africa; the International Fencing Federation is now made up of 157 national federation members.</p>
