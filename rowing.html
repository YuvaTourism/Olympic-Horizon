        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Rowing events have been staged at every Games since the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 (men’s events). However, because the competition was scheduled to take place at sea, it had to be cancelled that year due to bad weather. Women’s events were only officially included in the Olympic program much later, at the Games of Montréal in 1976.

                The USA initially dominated Olympic rowing, before the Soviet Union and Germany came to the forefront. Six-time Olympians Sir Steve Redgrave (five golds, one bronze) and Elisabeta Oleniuc-Lipă (five golds, two silvers, one bronze) are widely hailed as the greatest Olympic male and female rowers of all time.</p>
