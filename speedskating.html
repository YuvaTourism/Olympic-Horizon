        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Speed skating made its Olympic debut at the **1924 Winter Olympics** in Chamonix, France, as one of the original Winter Olympic sports. Initially, only men competed in four events: the 500 meters, 1500 meters, 5000 meters, and 10,000 meters. Athletes raced individually against the clock in timed events, a format that continues to be used today. The sport’s roots can be traced back to Northern Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, where skating on frozen canals was a popular winter pastime.

                Women’s speed skating was first featured as a demonstration event at the **1932 Winter Olympics** in Lake Placid, USA, and officially became a medal event at the **1960 Winter Olympics** in Squaw Valley, USA. Over time, more events were added, including the **Team Pursuit** in 2006, which involves teams of three skaters working together. Speed skating remains a major Olympic event, known for its precision, endurance, and high-speed competition.</p>
