        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">Mountain bike is a relatively new sport that emerged in the 1970s, when cyclists in California decided to take their bikes off-road and explore new trails. In the 1990s, the first mountain bikes that could withstand the impact of rougher terrain were created, and the hobby subsequently took off, quickly becoming a sport in its own right. The first informal competitions took place in the late 1970s before the first official world championships were held in the 1990s.</p>
