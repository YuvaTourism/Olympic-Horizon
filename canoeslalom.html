        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">For centuries, canoes were used as a means of transport (as well as a useful tool for hunting and fishing) in North America, Siberia, and Greenland. The sport of canoe slalom was modelled from ski slalom and began in Switzerland in 1932. The first contests were performed on flat water, but were later switched to whitewater rapids.Canoe slalom made its debut at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and became a permanent Olympic fixture at the 1992 Games in Barcelona. Athletes from European nations have achieved enormous success in the sport at the Games, winning roughly 90 per cent of all canoe slalom medals.</p>
