        <h2 class="heading3">History</h2>
            <p class="para">At the first three editions of the modern Olympic Games, all swimming events took place in a natural body of water prior to the inclusion of pools at the Games in 1908. Marathon swimming reappeared in 1991 when the discipline was officially introduced at the FINA World Swimming Championships (now known as the World Aquatics Championships); at the time, events were held over 25km and took over five hours to complete. The first time the 10km race was contested was at the World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan in 2001.
