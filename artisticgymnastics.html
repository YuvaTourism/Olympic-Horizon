            <p class="para">Artistic gymnastics was introduced at the very first Olympic Games of the modern era in 1896 and has been included in every edition since. The competition was restricted to male competitors for 32 years until the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, when women were allowed to compete for the first time. It wasn't until 1952 that the women’s programme was developed with seven events, and then later stabilised at six events, as has been the case since the 1960 Games in Rome. There are eight events on the men’s programme.</p>
